# Stereo-correspondence-of-images
Stereo vision is an important field of computer vision which creates a research problem i.e. to estimate the disparity. In recent years several algorithms have been adopted. The challenge is to determine the best approach to find the correspondence between the images. 

The stereo system consists of two cameras that are placed horizontally. These cameras capture the 3D image
simultaneously in different angles. The images are recovered and then processed to estimate the depth information.

The problem that arrives is the ambiguity in the occluded and texture less regions. The interpolation of the
mismatched and occluded pixels must be handled separately. we mainly focus on reduction of errors in the occluded and the texture less region with the help of the neighbouring pixels.
